I seek Your Word as counsel for every area of my life. I am quick to obey the instructions from Your word. The Bible is Your word to me.

There are a total of 14 stations along this path, based on events that occurred on the way to the Golgotha hill, the site of the crucifixion. At Holyland, the entire 14 steps are depicted to give one an overview of the suffering our Saviour went through for us.
